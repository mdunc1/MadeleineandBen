<h1>FAQs</h1>
<h2>When is the RSVP due?</h2>
<p>We kindly ask that all RSVPs are submitted before 01.02.26</p>
<h2>Can I bring a plus one?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately due to capacity limits we are unable to extend invites to plus ones. Only those listed on the envelope of the invitation have a seat reserved.</p>
<h2>Is there parking?</h2>
<p>There is a complimentary car park at the rear of the Castle for guests to use. This can be used overnight for residential guests. Please note there is no parking at any time in the Courtyard.</p>
<h2>Is there a gift registry?</h2>
<p>Gifts are by no means expected — your presence is truly the greatest gift we could ask for, 
    especially from those travelling across the world to celebrate with us. We are deeply grateful 
    for the love and effort this represents. Should you wish to give a gift, we will include a registry 
    link below soon. As we are extremely fortunate to be living with the wonderful Mother of the Bride during this 
    cost-of-living crisis, we have little need for additional household items. Instead, we are saving 
    to establish our own home, and contributions towards our home fund would be received with heartfelt thanks.
